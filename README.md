# smartSetSolverV1


Set is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple)

+Step 1: creating a model that recognize set cards cards : Please, open 0_3CopiedeSetSolverHub_V3_1.ipynb to understand how we did that

+Step 2: cards detection using Opencv

+Step 3: Apllying the model to detect cards
